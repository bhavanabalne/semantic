<B>antic tags are HTML tags that have a specific meaning. For example, the tag is a semantic tag that represents a heading. The <p> tag is another semantic tag that represents a paragraph.
 Semantic tags are important because they help to make your HTML code more readable and understandable for both humans and machines.</B>

<H1>NON Semantic tags</h1>
<B>
Non-semantic tags are HTML tags that do not have a specific meaning. For example, the <div> tag is a non-semantic tag that can be used to group elements together. The <span> tag is another non-semantic tag that can be used to style text. Non-semantic tags are often used for layout purposes, but they can also be used to add structure to your HTML code.</B>
